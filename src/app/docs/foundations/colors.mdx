# Colors

Our color system is **intent-based**. This means we define colors by *what they do* (e.g., `action-primary`), not *what they look like* (e.g., `blue-500`).

## Palette

<ColorPalette />

## Usage Rules

### Safe Usage

- Always use the semantic tokens (`bg-primary`, `text-primary-foreground`) instead of raw hex values.
- Ensure text contrast passes WCAG AA standards (our tokens are designed to do this automatically).

### Brand Colors

Brand colors should be used sparingly for primary actions or key visual moments. Do not overuse them for backgrounds.
