## Our Principles

We believe that accessibility is not a feature, but a fundamental requirement. Our Design System is built on the **POUR** validation method:

**Perceivable**: Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.<br/>
**Operable**: User interface components and navigation must be operable.<br/>
**Understandable**: Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable.<br/>
**Robust**: Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.

## Keyboard Navigation

All interactive elements must be usable with a keyboard alone.

<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4 my-6">
    <div className="p-4 border rounded-lg bg-yellow-500/10 border-yellow-500/20">
        <h4 className="font-bold text-yellow-500 mb-2">Focus Visible</h4>
        <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
            Never suppress the focus ring outline unless you are providing a custom, high-contrast alternative.
            The Design System provides a standardized `focus-visible` ring.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div className="p-4 border rounded-lg bg-blue-500/10 border-blue-500/20">
        <h4 className="font-bold text-blue-500 mb-2">Tab Order</h4>
        <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
            Ensure the tab order follows the visual flow of the page (left to right, top to bottom).
            Avoid using positive `tabindex` values (e.g., `tabindex="1"`).
        </p>
    </div>
</div>

## Screen Readers

### Semantic HTML
Use standard HTML elements (`<button>`, `<a href>`, `<input>`) whenever possible. They come with built-in accessibility features that div-soups lack.

### ARIA Labels
Use `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` only when the visual text label is missing or insufficient (e.g., an icon-only button).

```tsx
// ✅ Do this
<button aria-label="Close menu">
  <XIcon />
</button>

// ❌ Avoid this (screen reader reads "button")
<button>
  <XIcon />
</button>
```

## Color and Contrast

We strictly adhere to **WCAG 2.1 AA** standards for contrast. This means:
- **4.5:1** for normal text.
- **3:1** for large text (18pt+) and UI components (borders, icons).

<Callout type="warning" title="Don't rely on color alone">
    Status indicators like "Error" or "Success" must be accompanied by an icon or text label, not just a color change, to accommodate colorblind users.
</Callout>

## Animation & Motion

Respect the user's `prefers-reduced-motion` setting.

- **Essential Motion**: Transitions that guide the user (e.g., an accordion opening) are allowed but should be instant or cross-fade when reduced motion is requested.
- **Decorative Motion**: parallax, auto-playing videos, and heavy animations must be disabled.

<DoDontContainer>
  <DoDont type="do" title="Support Reduced Motion">
    Use CSS media queries or the `framer-motion` `useReducedMotion` hook to conditionally render animations.
  </DoDont>
  <DoDont type="dont" title="Auto-play Audio">
    Never auto-play audio or video with sound. It interferes with screen readers and can be disorienting.
  </DoDont>
</DoDontContainer>
