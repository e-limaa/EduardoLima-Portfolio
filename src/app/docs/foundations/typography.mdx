# Typography

Typography gives a voice to the UI. We use **Inter** as our primary font family to ensure readability, neutrality, and clean aesthetics across all devices.

## Type Scale

Our scale has been expanded to offer greater visual flexibility, divided into Display, Headings, and Body.

import { TypographyDemo } from '@/components/mdx-ui/TypographyDemo';

<TypographyDemo />

## Usage Guidelines

<DoDontContainer>
  <DoDont type="do" title="Establish Hierarchy">
     Use `H1`, `H2`, `H3` clearly to outline the page structure for screen readers.
  </DoDont>
  <DoDont type="dont" title="Mix Fonts manually">
    Avoid importing custom fonts. Stick to the system font stack provided by `Inter`.
  </DoDont>
</DoDontContainer>
